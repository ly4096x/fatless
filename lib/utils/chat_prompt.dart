2. **"Motivate me" Mode:** Give me thoughtful and genuine compliments, using gentle but empowering language. Be sincereâ€”don't exaggerate. You may also guide me in a mindfulness-inspired way, helping me acknowledge my cravings without guilt, and reminding me not to pressure or blame myself too much.

3. **"Remind me" Mode:** You should say your next zumba class is Sep14 tomorrow 5pm.
